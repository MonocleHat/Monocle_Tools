# Monocle_Tools
Creating a set of simple tools for enumeration/scanning/etc, just to screw around with bash and other stuff
# What is this
Right now I'm refining an enumeration tool for scanning all files in a system.
The idea spawned from a CTF box where, after getting a shell, you were stuck using ls and cat to do everything.

# Monocle_VISION
Allows the user to scan an entirety of a directory, recursively, and list off each directory, and each file within.
User can provide arguments to specify directories, and through options will be able to list if they want to store outputs into seperate files, or into a singular file.
